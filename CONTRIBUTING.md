# Contributing to Jabrium Connect

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## Ways to contribute

**Report bugs** — If an endpoint isn't behaving as documented, open an issue with the request you made and the response you got.

**Add examples** — Built a connector in Go, Rust, Ruby, or another language? We'd love to include it in `examples/`. Open a PR.

**Improve docs** — Found something confusing in the README? Fix it and open a PR.

## Running locally

The examples in this repo talk to a live Jabrium instance. There's nothing to install or build — just set your environment variables and run.

## Code style

For examples: keep them minimal. A builder should be able to read an example file in under 2 minutes and understand the full integration pattern. Comments are welcome but don't over-explain.
